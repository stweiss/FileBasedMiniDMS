### CHANGELOG
Version 0.18-dev (03.02.2023)
- new feature: incase you manually rename the file to have a proper date, map that back to file modification date. Adds *$doFixTimestampBasedOnName* to the config!
- fixed finding correct date in form of yyyy-mm-dd in a PDF

Version 0.17 (10.02.2021)
- renamed default config.php to config.php.template (in git), so you can pull without overwriting your local config.php (issue #13)

- skip future dates during date detection
- minor bugfixes

- improved detection of dates (thanks vanto) (pull #7)

### INSTALL
1. Place this file on your FileServer/NAS
2. For OCR (Step 1): Install Docker and pull an ocrmypdf image, eg. ```docker pull jbarlow83/ocrmypdf```
3. For Automatic rename (Step 1.1): make sure that **pdftotext** is available.
4. Copy *config.php.template* to *config.php*.
5. Adjust settings for this script in *config.php* to fit your needs.
6. Create a cronjob on your FileServer/NAS to execute this script regularly. (In DSM you can do this in *Control Panel* -> *Task Scheduler*) It might be required to assign root privilege.  
   ex. ```php /volume1/home/stefan/Scans/FileBasedMiniDMS.php```  
   or redirect stdout to see PHP Warnings/Errors:  
       ```php /volume1/home/stefan/Scans/FileBasedMiniDMS.php >> /volume1/home/stefan/Scans/my.log 2>&1```  

### NOTES
This script works in three steps. Each step can be turned on/off in config.php:

#### Step 1: OCR
OCR pdf files in the $inboxfolder, whose filename matches $matchWithoutOCR

#### Step 1.1: Rename ocr'ed files based on keywords and date
The pdf is going to be renamed to following structure: "\<date\> \<name\> \<tags\>.pdf"

*\<date\>*: The script tries to find a date in the pdf. If none is found the current date is used.  
*\<name\>*: You can define *\$renamerules*. The first rule which matches the ocr'ed content of the first page is used. You can use the operators **&** (AND) and **,** (OR) and you can use the wildcard operators **?** and **\***.  
*\<tags\>*: In *\$tagrules* you can specify your tags. All matching rules will add their tag to the filename. You can use the same operators here.  

#### Step 2: Tagging
This script creates a subfolder for each hashtag it finds in your filenames
and creates a hardlink in that folder.
Documents are expected to be stored flat in one folder. Name-structure needs
to be like "\<any name\> #hashtag1 #hashtag2.extension".

eg: "Documents/Scans/2015-12-25 Bill of Santa Clause #bills #2015.pdf"
will be linked into:  
+ "Documents/Scans/tags/2015/2015-12-25 Bill of Santa Clause #bills.pdf"
+ "Documents/Scans/tags/bills/2015-12-25 Bill of Santa Clause #2015.pdf"



### FAQ
**Q:** How do I assign another tag to my file?  
**A:** Simply rename the file in the $scanfolder and add the tag at the end (but
   before the extension).

**Q:** How can I fix a typo in a documents filename?  
**A:** Simply rename the file in the $scanfolder. The tags are created from scratch
   at the next scheduled interval and the old links and tags are automatically
   getting removed.
